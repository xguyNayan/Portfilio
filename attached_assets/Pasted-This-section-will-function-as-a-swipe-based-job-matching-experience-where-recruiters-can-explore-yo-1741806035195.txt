This section will function as a swipe-based job-matching experience, where recruiters can explore your profile just like they browse potential matches in Bumble.

The goal is to make hiring engaging and fun—if a recruiter likes what they see, they can swipe right to match and start a conversation. If they swipe left, they'll get a gentle nudge to reconsider.

🎨 UI & Aesthetic
Inspired by Bumble: Rounded profile cards, swipe animations, bold fonts, and engaging colors
Primary Colors:
Background: Soft white (#F7F7F7) for a clean look
Buttons & Accents: Golden Yellow (#FFBE00) (Bumble’s signature)
Text & Icons: Dark gray/black (#222222) for readability
Font Style: Use Bumble's signature "Proxima Nova" or "SF Pro" for a sleek, modern feel
Smooth Swipe Animation: Cards should slide seamlessly left/right, with a slight tilt effect
📌 How the Bumble UI Works in Your App
1️⃣ Swipe-Based Profile Browsing 🎭
🔹 Users (Recruiters) will see your profile in a centered card.
🔹 Swipe Right = "It's a Match!" → Opens a chat to connect.
🔹 Swipe Left = "C’mon, he's worth a chance! At least text." (A playful prompt to reconsider)
🔹 If a recruiter scrolls down, they see detailed info about you, just like scrolling down on a Bumble profile.

🎨 Design Details:
✔️ Profile Card: Large, rounded, and centered, taking up ~80% of the screen width
✔️ Your Name & Title: Bold at the top (e.g., John Doe – Full Stack Developer)
✔️ Profile Picture: Big, clear, and eye-catching
✔️ Short Bio: A few key lines about you (e.g., "Building scalable web apps with React & Node.js. Let’s connect!")
✔️ Skills & Experience: Scroll down to reveal a section listing key skills and past work
✔️ Action Buttons:

Swipe Right Gesture (Green checkmark, "Hire Me")
Swipe Left Gesture (Red cross, "Skip")
2️⃣ Scrolling Down Reveals More Info ⬇️
If a recruiter doesn’t want to immediately swipe, they can scroll down to see:
✔️ Tech Stack & Skills (with icons)
✔️ Portfolio Highlights (mini project previews)
✔️ Testimonials from past clients or employers
✔️ Certifications & Achievements

🎨 Design Details:
✔️ Well-spaced sections with subtle dividers
✔️ Bullet points & icons for easy readability
✔️ Clickable links to GitHub, LinkedIn, or personal website

3️⃣ Right Swipe = "It’s a Match!" 💛
✔️ If a recruiter swipes right, a pop-up animation appears saying “It’s a Match! Start a conversation.”
✔️ Automatically opens a chat window where they can message you directly.

🎨 Design Details:
✔️ "It’s a Match!" appears in a yellow pop-up box, centered on the screen
✔️ Confetti animation for excitement
✔️ Chat opens instantly

4️⃣ Left Swipe = "C’mon, he’s worth a chance!" 👀
✔️ If a recruiter swipes left, instead of instantly skipping, a playful message appears:

“C’mon, he’s worth a chance! At least text him.”
A "Give him a shot" button appears, allowing them to reconsider.
🎨 Design Details:
✔️ Lighthearted animation with a winking emoji
✔️ Soft shake effect on the screen to grab attention

5️⃣ Chat After Matching 💬
✔️ Once matched, a chat interface opens (like Bumble DMs)
✔️ Recruiters must send the first message (like Bumble’s women-first messaging rule)
✔️ If no message is sent in 24 hours, a reminder notification pops up.

✔️ Chat bubbles styled like Bumble DMs
✔️ Typing indicator for real-time feel
