📌 Project Vision: "My Interactive Portfolio App"
I want to create a personalized mobile UI that feels like a fusion of Instagram, Bumble, and ChatGPT, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and personality in a visually engaging way.

The app should feel like a social media experience, where users can:

Scroll through my portfolio like an Instagram feed
Explore my work in a Pinterest-style search section
Swipe through my profile in a Bumble-inspired UI
Chat with an AI version of me for information or guidance
Directly connect with me via an Instagram-like chat
This is not just a portfolio—it's an interactive way for people to experience who I am through familiar social media interactions.

🎨 UI & Aesthetic
Inspired by: Instagram (Navbar, Feed, Profile), Pinterest (Search Grid), Bumble (Swipe UI), ChatGPT (AI Chat)
Colors: Clean, modern look with white (#FFFFFF) background, black (#000000) text/icons, and a touch of blue (#0095F6, like Instagram’s accent color)
Font: Use Instagram’s “SF Pro” or "Roboto" for consistency
Animations: Smooth page transitions, swipe animations, and tap feedback
Spacing & Layout: Rounded corners, uniform padding, subtle drop shadows
📌 App Flow & Sections

Instead of the Instagram logo, display my name in the same style.
